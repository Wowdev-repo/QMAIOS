The Site includes three major features, the largest of which are the archaeological remains of the town, dating back to the 1760s.

By tackling the bold theme of war and peace in a domestic setting, they are all the more arresting. \n\n Gupta's practice shifts between different mediumsincluding painting, sculpure, photography, video and performance. Throughout his work, he uses objects that are recognizable icons of Indian life, such as domestic Kitchenware, bicycles, scooters and taxis. By relocating them from their original context, he elevates their status from common object to valued artwork"
